**C++ Calculator**

Welcome to the C++ Calculator repository, a console-based application developed to showcase fundamental programming principles in C++. This project serves both as a learning resource for beginners and as a practical tool for performing basic arithmetic operations.

### Key Features:

1. **Arithmetic Operations**: The calculator supports essential arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It handles both integer and floating-point operands efficiently, ensuring accurate computation across a wide range of inputs.

2. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling mechanisms are implemented, particularly for division by zero scenarios. These checks prevent runtime errors and maintain program stability, enhancing the calculator's reliability during operation.

3. **Modular Design**: The code is structured into modular functions, each responsible for executing a specific arithmetic operation. This design promotes code reusability, clarity, and maintainability, making it easier to expand functionality or modify existing features in the future.

4. **User Interface**: The user interface is designed for simplicity and ease of use. Upon execution, the calculator prompts users to enter two operands and select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). Results are displayed clearly on the console, accompanied by prompts for further calculations or program termination.

5. **Educational Value**: Beyond its practical utility, this project is intended to educate users on core C++ concepts. It demonstrates the implementation of functions, control structures (like if-else statements for error handling), and basic algorithmic logic essential for building more complex applications.

6. **Documentation**: The README file provides comprehensive instructions for downloading, compiling, and running the calculator on various operating systems. It also includes guidelines for contributing to the project, encouraging collaboration and improvement from the community.

### Usage:

To use the calculator, clone the repository and compile the source code using a C++ compiler compatible with your system. Follow the instructions in the README to execute the program and start performing calculations immediately.

### Contribution:

Contributions to the project are welcome! Whether you're interested in adding new features, improving existing functionality, or fixing bugs, please follow the outlined guidelines in the README file to maintain consistency and quality across contributions.

### Conclusion:

Explore this repository to deepen your understanding of C++ programming through practical application. Whether you're a novice programmer learning the basics or an experienced developer looking to refresh your skills, the C++ Calculator project offers valuable insights into software development principles and best practices.
