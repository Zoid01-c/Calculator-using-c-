# C++ Projects Repository

Welcome to the C++ Projects repository! This repository contains three simple console-based applications implemented in C++: a Calculator, a Guessing Game, and a To-Do List manager. Each project is designed to showcase fundamental programming concepts and provide practical examples for learning and exploration.

## Projects Included:

### 1. Calculator

The Calculator project allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

#### Features:
- Supports integer and floating-point calculations.
- Includes error handling for division by zero.
- Clear and intuitive user interface via console prompts.

### 2. Guessing Game

The Guessing Game challenges users to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. It demonstrates:
- Random number generation.
- User input handling and validation.
- Feedback on guesses (too high, too low, correct).

#### Features:
- Adjustable difficulty levels (range of numbers).
- Interactive gameplay with clear instructions.

### 3. To-Do List

The To-Do List project helps users manage tasks through a console interface:
- Add tasks with descriptions and due dates.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- View tasks sorted by due date or completion status.

#### Features:
- Task storage using data structures like arrays or linked lists.
- Simple CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Sorting tasks based on various criteria.
